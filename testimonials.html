        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"It's not only a good opportunity to work with professional developers to improve the 
        programming skills, but also a chance to learn biological knowledge and better understand the biological 
        systems through meeting with those experienced tutors."</i></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"I feel great to work with a group of enthusiastic biologists, engineers and developers on 
        many interesting projects."</i></b></blockquote>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"That is the very valuable experience and it could be very helpful for either job hunting or 
        applying gradate school. There are lots of people in this community know Cytoscape very well."</i></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"I already published one paper and another one is in preparation. All of them are based on my 
        GSoC projects with NRNB."</i></b></blockquote>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"Thanks to the participation and the projects done in Google Summer of Code with NRNB, I was 
        selected for an internship at INRIA Paris and also did my Undegrad thesis there subsequently. The experience 
        with NRNB helped improve my technical skills and gave me strong experience in professional software development."</i></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"I participated in the Google Summer of Code after my first year of Undergraduate Studies. It was an 
        amazing learning experience and introduced me to Open Source development. It helped me improve both my technical and 
        interpersonal skills."</i></b></blockquote>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"Involvement in the GSOC with NRNB was all upside for me. In my search for a network visualization tool 
        I found Cytoscape as the best alternative, but it lacked the capability to visualize dynamic graphs. Discussion with 
        the Cytoscape community rapidly progressed into mentoring a GSOC project with an excellent applicant. Ultimately I 
        gained the dynamic network visualization tool that I sought, along with experience as a mentor, experience in open-source 
        development, and in gaining a number of valuable academic contacts. All good!"</i></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"I made valuable academic contacts and also developed important software tools."</i></b></blockquote>

        <ul>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"Provided good initial contacts in the Network Biology community"</i></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"It opened new career opportunities for me, and allowed me to get new work experiences. I was able to 
        cite the experience in subsequent job interviews and it was very helpful to my career."</i></b></blockquote>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"The program exposed me to a new experience and allowed me to expand my knowledge in the field. By 
        engaging me and challenging me, my mentors made me learn a great deal. The program was a big boost to my career 
        advancement and it gave me the experience I needed to move towards my goals. As a student, the program allowed me 
        to deepen my technical knowledge and let me go beyond the theory that I learn in my studies. My mentors were incredibly 
        helpful and it was a remarkable learning experience."</i></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"It has had a great impact on my career and I learnt a lot during the period I worked with my mentor 
        Mr. Augustin Luna. It was fun, very wonderful and and extremely productive experience. Working with XSLT and other 
        related technologies in developing the plugin also helped me through my job in India."</i></b></blockquote>

        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"I had co-authored a paper along with my mentors for GSOC. This was a huge surprising bonus along with 
        the other benefits of being a GSOC student of NRNB. This gave an edge to my grad-application when I applied to universities 
        for my MS in Comouter Science."</i></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"I was part of the Google Summer of Code program in collaboration with NRNB. I had the opportunity 
        to learn and work with Mr.Augustin Luna (main mentor) and Dr. Martijn P. van Iersel (my secondary mentor). I had never 
        been part of such a big project until I worked with NRNB. It was great to work on my plugin from scratch and integrating 
        the things with PathVisio and working with Pathvisio's source code base. Lot of days I worked with my mentor Mr.Augustin 
        way past our usual timings in the night and that was fun. Suddenly we would come up with a solution to a particular 
        problem and this was very satiating."</i></b></blockquote>

        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"It certainly was a big boost for my career. I was told by my actual employer that one of the things that 
        made my resume stand out was my experience from GSoC with NRNB."</i></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"I simply had no involvement at all with the Network Biology research community prior to the NRNB training 
        programs I took part in, and now I'm actually starting to work on a Master Thesis (in computer science) that will heavily 
        involve Cytoscape and other NRNB tools."</i></b></blockquote>

        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"In my personal opinion, the 3 GSoC NRNB programs I took part in were hugely successful for my career. I did 
        not only got involved with the Network Biology research community, but also with open source software development and a lot 
        of techniques and tools that were previously unknown to me. I really hope these training programs continue, so that many more 
        people can have the same opportunity that I did."</i></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"I started graduate school the year after completing GSoC. My experiences during the summer of 2010 helped to 
        prepare me for that endeavor. In particular, my graduate program requires all first year students to take a programming exam, 
        and my experience with GSoC turned out to be a fantastic way to study for this exam."</i></b></blockquote>

        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"My direct line of research has drifted away from network biology since completing GSoC, however my experiences 
        have enabled me to help/mentor others in my research group who do work directly on problems in network biology."</i></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"I had absolutely fantastic mentors when I participated in GSoC in the summer of 2010. I believe they were a large 
        reason why I feel that this program really helped to give me a leg up in both confidence and skill when I started graduate 
        school."</i></b></blockquote>

        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"Before NRNB I have had no contact whatsoever with the Network Biology research community. Now, I have written and 
        published several pieces of code that are being used by biologists."</i></b></blockquote>

        <ul>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote><i>"I have had great pleasure working on the NRNB training programs, and I can say that I've greatly benefited from them. 
        Not only I was introduced to the Network Biology research community, but I also learnt many technical skills along the way. 
        Currently, I'm participating for a last time as a student in NRNB GSoC, and after my upcoming graduation I am definitely interested 
        in continuing my involvement with this great community. If it weren't for NRNB training programs, I would have never got in touch 
        with the people I'm working on, nor with this amazing field of study."</i></blockquote>
