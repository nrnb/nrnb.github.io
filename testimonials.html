            <h3>Testimonials</h3>

            <p>NRNB values feedback from the network biology community. Below is a collection of 
            testimonials collected from collaborators, users and students when asked how their 
            interaction with NRNB has impacted their involvement with the network biology community
            as well as their carreer opportunities and training.</p>

        <blockquote2><p>"It's not only a good opportunity to work with professional developers to improve the 
        programming skills, but <b>also a chance to learn biological knowledge and better understand the biological 
        systems through meeting with those experienced tutors.</b>"</p></blockquote>

        <blockquote2><p>"That is the very valuable experience and it could be <b>very helpful for either job hunting or 
        applying gradate school</b>. There are lots of people in this community know Cytoscape very well."</p></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote2><p>"I already published one paper and another one is in preparation. All of them are based on my

        <blockquote2><p>"Thanks to the participation and the projects done in Google Summer of Code with NRNB, I was 
        selected for an internship at INRIA Paris and also did my Undegrad thesis there subsequently. The experience 
        with NRNB helped improve my technical skills and gave me strong experience in professional software development."</p></blockquote>

        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote2><p>"I participated in the Google Summer of Code after my first year of Undergraduate Studies. It was an 
        amazing learning experience and introduced me to Open Source development. It helped me improve both my technical and 
        interpersonal skills."</p></blockquote>

        <blockquote2><p>"Involvement in the GSOC with NRNB was all upside for me. In my search for a network visualization tool 
        I found Cytoscape as the best alternative, but it lacked the capability to visualize dynamic graphs. Discussion with 
        the Cytoscape community rapidly progressed into mentoring a GSOC project with an excellent applicant. Ultimately I 
        gained the dynamic network visualization tool that I sought, along with experience as a mentor, experience in open-source 
        development, and in gaining a number of valuable academic contacts. All good!"</p></blockquote>

        <li class="span6">
        <blockquote2><p>"I have had great pleasure working on the NRNB training programs, and I can say that I've greatly benefited from them. 
        Not only I was introduced to the Network Biology research community, but I also learnt many technical skills along the way. 
        Currently, I'm participating for a last time as a student in NRNB GSoC, and after my upcoming graduation I am definitely interested 
        in continuing my involvement with this great community. If it weren't for NRNB training programs, I would have never got in touch 
        with the people I'm working on, nor with this amazing field of study."</p></blockquote>

        engaging me and challenging me, my mentors made me learn a great deal. The program was a big boost to my career 
        advancement and it gave me the experience I needed to move towards my goals. As a student, the program allowed me 
        to deepen my technical knowledge and let me go beyond the theory that I learn in my studies. My mentors were incredibly 
        helpful and it was a remarkable learning experience."</p></blockquote>

        to learn and work with Mr.Augustin Luna (main mentor) and Dr. Martijn P. van Iersel (my secondary mentor). I had never 
        been part of such a big project until I worked with NRNB. It was great to work on my plugin from scratch and integrating 
        the things with PathVisio and working with Pathvisio's source code base. Lot of days I worked with my mentor Mr.Augustin 
        way past our usual timings in the night and that was fun. Suddenly we would come up with a solution to a particular 
        problem and this was very satiating."</p></blockquote>

        the other benefits of being a GSOC student of NRNB. This gave an edge to my grad-application when I applied to universities 
        for my MS in Comouter Science."</p></blockquote>

        not only got involved with the Network Biology research community, but also with open source software development and a lot 
        of techniques and tools that were previously unknown to me. I really hope these training programs continue, so that many more

        prepare me for that endeavor. In particular, my graduate program requires all first year students to take a programming exam, 
        and my experience with GSoC turned out to be a fantastic way to study for this exam."</p></blockquote>

        school."</p></blockquote>
