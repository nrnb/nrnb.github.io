				<h3>Project A: Identification of network-based biomarkers for
					molecular classification</h3>
				<h4>
					Project Leaders: <a href="people.html#sander">Chris Sander</a>

				</h4>

				<div class="well">
					<p>
						In this project, we will develop technology to <b>automatically
							identify altered disease networks and enable the discovery of
							network-based biomarkers in cancer.</b> Recentiy, we and others have
						shown proof of principle that networks and pathways provide a
						powerful tool to understand the pronounced genetic heterogeneity
						seen in individual tumors of the same cancer type and that they
						can lead to more accurate and robust signatures for classifying
						disease states. To date, such methods have been explored in
						glioblastoma multiforme as well as pancreatic, lung, breast and
						colorectal cancers . The algorithmic research and Cytoscape
						development in this TRD will be tied to analyzing multiple cancer
						types derived from The Cancer Genome Afias Project, prostate
						cancer genome data derived from the MSKCC Prostate Cancer Genome
						Project (PCGP, a collaborator), and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.
						An additional user of the tools developed here will be a
						collaboration studying prostate cancer using a genomics approach.
					</p>
					<p>We seek to address the following open issues to
						network-based biomarker identification:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Identification of perturbed subnetworks and
								pathways across cancers and cancer subtypes.</b> This track will
							extend the Ideker group's ActiveModules method which searches a
							biomolecular interaction network to identify connected
							subnetworks for which the average expression level is higher than
							(or more differentially-expressed than) expected. This track will
							also implement Chris Sander's NetBox approach for identifying
							frequently altered network modules within individual cancer
							types. These network modules or cohesive groups of interconnected
							genes are indicative of altered pathways in cancer, and have been
							algorithmically identified in glioblastoma (Cerami, Sander et al.
							publication in review).</li>
						<li><b>Network-based classification of tumors.</b> This
							algorithm will extend and implement the Ideker lab's recent work
							in breast cancer classification to identify connected subnetworks
							(extracted from protein interaction networks) and canonical
							pathways (i.e. annotated sets of genes from pathway databases)
							whose expression patterns maximally discriminate between tumors
							of a specific clinical type. The method will be benchmarked on
							the many published expression data sets that have been gathered
							for distinguishing primary from metastatic cancer.</li>
						<li><b>Integration of drug-target networks with
								dysregulated pathways.</b> This algorithm will seek to automatically
							link known drug-target networks with dysregulated pathways
							identified by the algorithms above. Producing such an integrated
							drug-target network will be an important first step in assessing
							new cancer therapies, rationally developing combination
							therapies, and tailoring choice of therapy to a patient's genetic
							profile.</li>
					</ul>

					<img src="images/F5.png" width="700" /><br /> <b>Figure:
						BioNetMarker Plugin and its application to data derived from the
						TCGA Project.</b> The creation of BioNetMarker Cytoscape Plugin will
					be tied to the analysis of cancer genomics data derived from the
					TCGA project, as described in DBP 1. The five steps in using the
					plugin are outlined. We envision that the plugin will be broadly
					useful for identifying active and discriminating networks in
					multiple diseases.

				<h3>Project B: Using Cytoscape for Social Network Research </h3>
				<h4>
					Project Leader: <a href="people.html#fowler">James Fowler</a>
					(UCSD)
				</h4>

				<div class="well">

					<p>
						Social networks are increasingly recognized as having an important
						effect on a wide variety of human behaviors, affecting the spread
						of health outcomes (AIDS, obesity, drinking and smoking behavior),
						emotional states (depression, loneliness, and happiness), and
						political outcomes (legislative activity, judicial decisions, and
						terrorist events). However, the statistical tools used to study
						these effects are drawn from a tradition that focuses on dyads, or
						sets of two people who are socially connected. When we find an
						association in behavior within dyads, we typically cannot
						distinguish three possible explanations. 1) <i>Homophily:</i>
						people might choose to be friends with others because they have
						the same behavior. In other words, birds of a feather might flock
						together. 2) <i>Context:</i> there might be variation in the
						environment than causes both individuals in a dyad to exhibit the
						same behavior. For example, poor neighborhoods might create
						environments that promote less healthy behaviors, causing an
						association between friends who live in the same neighborhood. 3)
						<i>Influence:</i> one person in the dyad actually influences the
						other in some way to cause their behavior to become more like
						their own.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are developing a Network Correlation Cytoscape App in collaboration 
						Dr. Alex Pico. In order to understand why so many behaviors are 
						influenced by social connections, a tool must be developed that is 
						able to determine the variable contribution of a given set of potential 
						causes (such as homophily, context, and influence effects). This 
						technology can then be used to determine the underlying causes behind 
						the spread of various behaviors (health, political, emotional) in networks 
						of different types and across different time points. The emerging techniques 
						and tools will be broadly applicable to the study of social network influence 
						on health behaviors such as eating habits, alcohol consumption, and drug use.

				<h3>Project C: Visualization and Representation of Biological
					Networks</h3>
				<h4>
					Project Leaders: <a href="people.html#bader">Gary Bader</a> (U
					Toronto) and <a href="people.html#alex">Alex Pico</a>
					(Gladstone/UCSF)

				<div class="well">
					<p>Biologists frequently use networks to represent the
						structure and function of the cell, using intuitive metaphors to
						reduce multiple levels of spatial and temporal relationships to a
						two-dimensional image. At the same time, computational
						representations of the cell are more abstract and tend to be less
						intuitive for biologists than human-made diagrams. This section
						describes planned improvements to the biological relevance of
						computational visualizations of biological networks in Cytoscape.
						Intuitive biological network visualizations may one day replace
						printed biology textbooks as the primary resource for knowledge
						about cellular processes.</p>
					<p>Imagine being able to view the entire network of genes and
						gene products working in a cell. Then freeze the cell at a moment
						in time, and zoom to visualize the location, state, and
						interconnections of a collection of molecules in a particular
						subcellular location. Zoom in further to identify the splice
						isoforms and variants resulting from that particular genome being
						processed in that tissue, at that time, under specific conditions.
						We are a long way from such an ideal cellular exploration system.
						Instead, biological systems are typically visualized as "ball and
						stick" networks that include only pairwise connections between
						nodes. This representation has many limitations, such as the
						inability to convey detailed knowledge about biological processes
						and their dynamics (e.g. biochemical reactions which are three-way
						relationships between metabolic substrates, products, and enzymes)
						and poor visualization of very large numbers of nodes and links as
						are present in the cell (e.g. resulting in visual "hairballs").</p>
					<p>To overcome these challenges, we are develop new methods for visualizing 
					and exploring very large biological networks that reduce visual complexity 
					and enhance cognitive value compared to the traditional network display. These 
					approaches will exploit the hierarchical and modular organization of biological 
					networks and the large amount of information available about nodes and edges, 
					such as Gene Ontology annotations of gene function. We are developing visualization 
					methods in the following areas: 
					<ul>
						<li><b>Simplifying network views by hierarchically
								organizing networks and their modules.</b> Biological networks are
							inherently modular (e.g. pathways and complexes) and hierarchical
							(e.g. sub-pathways and complex subunits). Biological networks are inherently 
							modular (e.g. pathways and complexes) and hierarchical (e.g. sub-pathways and 
							complex subunits). We are developing methods to organize networks hierarchically 
							and to visually explore these hierarchies.  
							First, we will identify modular structures in the
							network using a set of known modules (e.g. from gene annotation)
							or by using existing clustering approaches and module detection
							methods developed in TRD A, B and currently available in
							Cytoscape. Next, modules will be rendered visually as individual
							nodes connected by their inter-module relationships. This module
							network is potentially hierarchical, in that each module defines
							a sub-network, which may also contain modules. Visualization
							methods will support modules with hidden or visible child nodes
							and module overlap (e.g. for protein complexes that share
							subunits). New automatic layout algorithms will be developed to
							clearly organize modular, hierarchical networks using
							partitioning and module-defined layout templates.</li>
						<li><b>Showing only the information needed across multiple levels of detail 
						(semantic zooming) and data sources (information layering).</b> The complete 
						view of a large protein interaction network would be extremely cluttered if 
						it included all protein details, such as the sequences or structures of all 
						proteins. Ideally, as the user zooms in to progressively focus in on an area 
						of interest, more details about that area are shown (semantic zooming). Further, 
						users should be able to select information of interest to be viewed on the network 
						(information layering). We will develop methods to interactively navigate networks 
						across multiple levels of detail, from whole cell to subfeatures of a node 
						(e.g. protein domains, exons). This will support multiple biological network types, 
						such as pathways and protein interaction networks, via the visualization of different 
						types of biological details at the module level (e.g. exons, splice sites, polymorphisms, 
						miRNA target sites, protein domains and post-translational modifications) and at the 
						molecular group level (complexes, paralogs, haplotypes, chromosomal regions and pathways). 
						We will develop information layer-based visualization strategies, where node and edge 
						attributes, such as gene expression profiles, will be represented as different layers 
						that can be interactively switched on and off.</li>
						<li><b>Simultaneously viewing network attributes
							collected from many biological experiments.</b> Proteins and genes in biological 
							networks are associated with an increasing amount of data from multiple experiments, 
							such as gene expression from time-series or across normal and disease states. Ideally, 
							this multi-dimensional information would be visualized in the context of networks. 
							We are extending Cytoscape to support new types of visualizations to enable multiple 
							node and edge data to be visualized at the same time.</li>
						<li><b>Analyzing Complex Networks Using Ontologies.</b>The development of high-throughput 
						technology has given rise to an enormous increase of data on biomolecular expression and 
						interactions, which results in protein interaction networks, gene regulatory networks, 
						signaling networks and metabolic networks. One approach to understanding networks relies on 
						ontologies, such as Gene Ontology, and enrichment analysis. We are developing network functional 
						analysis methods that take into consideration network topology. Our NOA app implements the NOA 
						algorithm for network-based enrichment analysis, which extends Gene Ontology annotations to 
						network links, or edges. The NOA app facilitates the annotation and analysis of one or more 
						networks in Cytoscape according to user-defined parameters. In addition to tables, the NOA 
						app also presents results in the form of heatmaps and overview networks in Cytoscape, which 
						can be exported for publication figures.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Researchers need tools to not only aid in the collection and
						processing of large-scale datasets, but also to make sense of the
						data in the familiar context of biological pathways. The
						visualization methods that we will develop will enable a view of
						the cell that is intuitive to biologists and that leads them
						quickly to new discoveries - where a researcher exclaims "Aha! Now
						I understand the relationships in my data and can formulate a new
						hypothesis!" as a result of exploring a network in Cytoscape.</p>

				<h3>Project D: Predictive Modeling and Network Inference</h3>
				<h4>
					Project Leaders: <a href="people.html#benno">Benno Schwikowski</a>
					(Institut Pasteur)
				</h4>

				<div class="well">
					<p>The objectives of this TRD are to (1) Create 'fill-in-the-algorithm' infrastructure 
					for network inference and (2) Make methods accessible to biologists within the Cytoscape 
					framework. Our approach is to create a software infrastructure (CYNI) for network inference 
					algorithms.</p>

					<p>The Cyni Toolbox app is available from the Cytoscape App Store (link) and is also available 
					here (http://www.proteomics.fr/Sysbio/CyniProject). Data imputation and discretization techniques 
					are provided along with several known inference algorithms to make this tool fully operational for 
					any kind of inference requirement. While data imputation and discretization techniques allow you 
					modify Cytoscape tables, network inference algorithms produce a new network after applying the chosen technique.
				
					<p>Cyni Toolbox is not only an application to perform a result, but it also provides a framework 
					for other app developers to facilitate the implementation of other algorithms. The goal of the 
					Cyni framework is to provide standardized, extensible and configurable default solutions for all 
					components different from the core algorithms, such as GUI, parameter handling, and configuration 
					of distance/similarity measures. Thereby, developers can focus on their core expertise. Tutorials 
					are available for Cyni Toolbox users as well as for developing new algorithms through Cyni.</p>
