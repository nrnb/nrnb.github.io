				<h3>Project A: Identification of network-based biomarkers for
					molecular classification</h3>
				<h4>
					Project Leaders: <a href="people.html#sander">Chris Sander</a>
					(MSKCC) and <a href="people.html#trey">Trey Ideker</a> (UCSD)
				</h4>

				<div class="well">
					<p>
						In this project, we will develop technology to <b>automatically
							identify altered disease networks and enable the discovery of
							network-based biomarkers in cancer.</b> Recentiy, we and others have
						shown proof of principle that networks and pathways provide a
						powerful tool to understand the pronounced genetic heterogeneity
						seen in individual tumors of the same cancer type and that they
						can lead to more accurate and robust signatures for classifying
						disease states. To date, such methods have been explored in
						glioblastoma multiforme as well as pancreatic, lung, breast and
						colorectal cancers . The algorithmic research and Cytoscape
						development in this TRD will be tied to analyzing multiple cancer
						types derived from The Cancer Genome Afias Project, prostate
						cancer genome data derived from the MSKCC Prostate Cancer Genome
						Project (PCGP, a collaborator), and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.
						An additional user of the tools developed here will be a
						collaboration studying prostate cancer using a genomics approach.
					</p>
					<p>We seek to address the following open issues to
						network-based biomarker identification:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Identification of perturbed subnetworks and
								pathways across cancers and cancer subtypes.</b> This track will
							extend the Ideker group's ActiveModules method which searches a
							biomolecular interaction network to identify connected
							subnetworks for which the average expression level is higher than
							(or more differentially-expressed than) expected. This track will
							also implement Chris Sander's NetBox approach for identifying
							frequently altered network modules within individual cancer
							types. These network modules or cohesive groups of interconnected
							genes are indicative of altered pathways in cancer, and have been
							algorithmically identified in glioblastoma (Cerami, Sander et al.
							publication in review).</li>
						<li><b>Network-based classification of tumors.</b> This
							algorithm will extend and implement the Ideker lab's recent work
							in breast cancer classification to identify connected subnetworks
							(extracted from protein interaction networks) and canonical
							pathways (i.e. annotated sets of genes from pathway databases)
							whose expression patterns maximally discriminate between tumors
							of a specific clinical type. The method will be benchmarked on
							the many published expression data sets that have been gathered
							for distinguishing primary from metastatic cancer.</li>
						<li><b>Integration of drug-target networks with
								dysregulated pathways.</b> This algorithm will seek to automatically
							link known drug-target networks with dysregulated pathways
							identified by the algorithms above. Producing such an integrated
							drug-target network will be an important first step in assessing
							new cancer therapies, rationally developing combination
							therapies, and tailoring choice of therapy to a patient's genetic
							profile.</li>
					</ul>

						BioNetMarker Plugin and its application to data derived from the
						TCGA Project.</b> The creation of BioNetMarker Cytoscape Plugin will
					be tied to the analysis of cancer genomics data derived from the
					TCGA project, as described in DBP 1. The five steps in using the
					plugin are outlined. We envision that the plugin will be broadly
					useful for identifying active and discriminating networks in
					multiple diseases.

				<h3>Project B: Recognizing trend motifs and dynamics in social
					networks</h3>
				<h4>
					Project Leader: <a href="people.html#fowler">James Fowler</a>
					(UCSD)
				</h4>

				<div class="well">

					<p>
						Social networks are increasingly recognized as having an important
						effect on a wide variety of human behaviors, affecting the spread
						of health outcomes (AIDS, obesity, drinking and smoking behavior),
						emotional states (depression, loneliness, and happiness), and
						political outcomes (legislative activity, judicial decisions, and
						terrorist events). However, the statistical tools used to study
						these effects are drawn from a tradition that focuses on dyads, or
						sets of two people who are socially connected. When we find an
						association in behavior within dyads, we typically cannot
						distinguish three possible explanations. 1) <i>Homophily:</i>
						people might choose to be friends with others because they have
						the same behavior. In other words, birds of a feather might flock
						together. 2) <i>Context:</i> there might be variation in the
						environment than causes both individuals in a dyad to exhibit the
						same behavior. For example, poor neighborhoods might create
						environments that promote less healthy behaviors, causing an
						association between friends who live in the same neighborhood. 3)
						<i>Influence:</i> one person in the dyad actually influences the
						other in some way to cause their behavior to become more like
						their own.
					</p>
					<p>In this project, we will develop algorithms for analyzing
						trend motifs in networks. Trend motifs are small patterns in a
						network that change over time. These will be used to study the
						spread of behaviors across social networks, primarily supporting
						research in DBP 3 (Role of social networks in the spread of
						disease). However, trend motifs are expected to be widely useful
						and will also be applied to cancer time series progression data
						from DBPs 1 and 2. The work will also provide a framework for a
						collaboration to work towards understanding the genetic basis of
						social networks. The algorithms will be developed and made freely
						available as Cytoscape plugins.</p>
					<p>
						The understanding of collective behavior in social networks is of
						great importance for a wide range of topics, spanning the
						development of disease intervention strategies to the
						identification of terrorist threats. Therefore, the <b>primary
							aim</b> of this proposal is <i>to develop a technology that
							distinguishes between homophily, context, and influence effects
							in dynamic social networks, and apply this analysis tool to the
							examination of health network databases such as the Framingham
							Heart Study and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
							Health.</i> This technology will be developed using the Cytoscape
						software infrastructure as Cytoscape plugin. In order to
						understand why so many behaviors are influenced by social
						connections, a tool must be developed that is able to detemiine
						the variable contribution of a given set of potential causes (such
						as homophily, context, and influence effects). This technology can
						then be used to determine the underlying causes behind the spread
						of various behaviors (health, political, emotional) in networks of
						different types and across different time points. The emerging
						techniques and tools will be broadly applicable to the study of
						social network influence on health behaviors such as eating
						habits, alcohol consumption, and drug use.
					</p>
					<p>We will also use the technology to explore the effect of
						network structure on these behaviors. Given the evidence for
						clustering of obesity, we expect local structures to have
						important impacts on an individual's exposure to health behaviors
						and outcomes that go beyond dyadic transmission. We will also
						study the effect of structure on smoking and drinking behaviors,
						political behaviors, and the emotional contagion of happiness,
						depression, and loneliness.</p>

				<h3>Project C: Visualization and Representation of Biological
					Networks</h3>
				<h4>
					Project Leaders: <a href="people.html#bader">Gary Bader</a> (U
					Toronto) and <a href="people.html#alex">Alex Pico</a>
					(Gladstone/UCSF)
				</h4>

				<div class="well">
					<p>Biologists frequently use networks to represent the
						structure and function of the cell, using intuitive metaphors to
						reduce multiple levels of spatial and temporal relationships to a
						two-dimensional image. At the same time, computational
						representations of the cell are more abstract and tend to be less
						intuitive for biologists than human-made diagrams. This section
						describes planned improvements to the biological relevance of
						computational visualizations of biological networks in Cytoscape.
						Intuitive biological network visualizations may one day replace
						printed biology textbooks as the primary resource for knowledge
						about cellular processes.</p>
					<p>Imagine being able to view the entire network of genes and
						gene products working in a cell. Then freeze the cell at a moment
						in time, and zoom to visualize the location, state, and
						interconnections of a collection of molecules in a particular
						subcellular location. Zoom in further to identify the splice
						isoforms and variants resulting from that particular genome being
						processed in that tissue, at that time, under specific conditions.
						We are a long way from such an ideal cellular exploration system.
						Instead, biological systems are typically visualized as "ball and
						stick" networks that include only pairwise connections between
						nodes. This representation has many limitations, such as the
						inability to convey detailed knowledge about biological processes
						and their dynamics (e.g. biochemical reactions which are three-way
						relationships between metabolic substrates, products, and enzymes)
						and poor visualization of very large numbers of nodes and links as
						are present in the cell (e.g. resulting in visual "hairballs").</p>
					<p>To overcome these challenges, we will develop new methods
						for visualizing and exploring very large biological networks that
						reduce visual complexity and enhance cognitive value compared to
						the traditional network display. These approaches will exploit the
						hierarchical and modular organization of biological networks and
						the large amount of information available about nodes and edges,
						such as Gene Ontology annotations of gene function. We will
						develop visualization methods in the following areas driven by DBP
						4 and DBP 5:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Simplifying network views by hierarchically
								organizing networks and their modules.</b> Biological networks are
							inherently modular (e.g. pathways and complexes) and hierarchical
							(e.g. sub-pathways and complex subunits). We will develop methods
							to organize networks hierarchically and to visually explore these
							hierarchies. First, we will identify modular structures in the
							network using a set of known modules (e.g. from gene annotation)
							or by using existing clustering approaches and module detection
							methods developed in TRD A, B and currently available in
							Cytoscape. Next, modules will be rendered visually as individual
							nodes connected by their inter-module relationships. This module
							network is potentially hierarchical, in that each module defines
							a sub-network, which may also contain modules. Visualization
							methods will support modules with hidden or visible child nodes
							and module overlap (e.g. for protein complexes that share
							subunits). New automatic layout algorithms will be developed to
							clearly organize modular, hierarchical networks using
							partitioning and module-defined layout templates.</li>
						<li><b>Showing only the information needed across
								multiple levels of detail (semantic zooming) and data sources
								(information layering).</b> The complete view of a large protein
							interaction network would be extremely cluttered if it included
							all protein details, such as the sequences or structures of all
							proteins. Ideally, as the user zooms in to progressively focus in
							on an area of interest, more details about that area are shown
							(semantic zooming). Further, users should be able to select
							information of interest to be viewed on the network (information
							layering). We will develop methods to interactively navigate
							networks across multiple levels of detail, from whole cell to
							subfeatures of a node (e.g. protein domains, exons). This will
							support multiple biological network types, such as pathways and
							protein interaction networks, via the visualization of different
							types of biological details at the module level (e.g. exons,
							splice sites, polymorphisms, miRNA target sites, protein domains
							and post-translational modifications) and at the molecular group
							level (complexes, paralogs, haplotypes, chromosomal regions and
							pathways). We will develop information layer-based visualization
							strategies, where node and edge attributes, such as gene
							expression profiles, will be represented as different layers that
							can be interactively switched on and off.</li>
						<li><b>Simultaneously viewing network attributes
								collected from many biological experiments.</b> Proteins and genes
							in biological networks are associated with an increasing amount
							of data from multiple experiments, such as gene expression from
							time-series or across normal and disease states. Ideally, this
							multi-dimensional information would be visualized in the context
							of networks. We will extend the Cytoscape visual mapping system
							to support multiple node and edge data attributes at the same
							time using new types of visual attributes.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						To develop visualizations that are effective for exploring
						biological networks, we will take advantage of recent developments
						in Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) power and technology developed
						in the field of Information Visualization (InfoVis), such as the <a
							href="http://ivtk.sourceforge.net/">InfoVis Toolkit</a>. We will
						also work with InfoVis and Human Computer Interaction researchers
						to ensure that our novel network visualization methods will ease
						network< navigation compared to current best methods.
					</p>
					<p>Researchers need tools to not only aid in the collection and
						processing of large-scale datasets, but also to make sense of the
						data in the familiar context of biological pathways. The
						visualization methods that we will develop will enable a view of
						the cell that is intuitive to biologists and that leads them
						quickly to new discoveries - where a researcher exclaims "Aha! Now
						I understand the relationships in my data and can formulate a new
						hypothesis!" as a result of exploring a network in Cytoscape.</p>

				<h3>Project D: Predictive Modeling and Network Inference</h3>
				<h4>
					Project Leaders: <a href="people.html#benno">Benno Schwikowski</a>
					(Institut Pasteur)
				</h4>

				<div class="well">
					<p>We propose to create an extension to the Cytoscape network
						visualization and analysis platform that will significantly
						facilitate the implementation of state-of-the-art
						clustering/classification and network inference algorithms for
						biology and other domains. Based on numerous available data sets
						(e.g. gene expression), these methods will propose connections
						between components in specific biological systems under study.
						This will be driven by and directly applicable to DBP 6
						(Discovering agents that boost innate antimicrobial defenses).
						This research will also be used by the BaSysBio Project, which
						seeks to better understand dynamic gene regulation in bacteria.</p>

					<p>Our broad objective is to make network induction more
						accessible to biologists by providing a user-friendly solution
						that lends itself to iterative application between computational
						network inference and experimentation. Specifically:
					<ol type="1">
						<li>It will provide an extensible framework for the
							implementation of a variety of clustering, classification, and
							network inference (from now on summarized as "network learning")
							algorithms. This will be done through a set of Application
							Programmer Interfaces (APIs) specific to clustering,
							classification, and network inference with supports for module
							networks.</li>
						<li>We will initially implement simple
							clustering/classification and network inference algorithms,
							enabling a first working solution.</li>
						<li>The framework will offer a flexible Graphical User
							Interface (GUI) to select algorithms to be used, input data, and
							algorithm parameters.</li>
						<li>It will offer the possibility to provide restrictions
							(e.g., from prior knowledge or experimental evidence) to network
							learning algorithms through the graphical user interface.</li>
						<li>We will develop and implement a state-of-the-art network
							inference algorithm that supports module networks and the
							inclusion of prior knowledge.</li>
						<li>The framework will be embedded into Cytoscape to:
							<ul>
								<li>Allow input of restrictions through a GUI,</li>
								<li>Allow the visual inspection of the output of these
									algorithms, and to</li>
								<li>Provide numerous other network analysis functionality,
									such as numerous layout functions, flexible visualization of
									node/edge attributes and modules, and access to a variety of
									data sources</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>We plan to study the usability of the new approach in an
						iterative context with our biological collaborators.</p>
