		<h2>What is Network Biology?</h2>
		<p>Analysis of biological networks has exploded in recent years. A
			wide variety of technologies have been introduced for mapping
			networks of gene and protein interactions, including yeast-two-hybrid
			assays, affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry, chromatin
			immunoprecipitation measurements, synthetic-lethal and suppressor
			networks, expression QTLs, and many others. These technologies have
			the potential to revolutionize the study of human health, by enabling
			the construction of large pathway maps which can pinpoint the
			molecular mechanisms underlying normal and disease states of
			biological systems. However, the enormous variety and number of new
			molecular interaction measurements necessitate new algorithms,
			conceptual frameworks, and software to integrate, query, visualize,
			and interpret the resulting network data.</p>

				<p>A wide range of computational techniques are being developed
					in order to analyze biological network data to address specific
					problems with relevance to basic biology and human health:</p>
				<p>
					<b>Gene function prediction.</b> This is a basic but important
					problem, since the majority of genes in most genomes have no known
					function. Examining genes in a network context can help answer this
					question. For example, a protein of unknown function connected to a
					set of proteins involved in the same biological process is likely
					to also function in that process.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Detection of protein complexes and other modular structures.</b>
					Although interaction networks are based on raw pair-wise
					interactions, there is clear evidence in these networks for
					modularity and principles of higher-order organization. Can we
					determine how networks are organized and create abstractions that
					serve as effective descriptions of network features? A number of
					groups have tried to answer this question through analysis of the
					molecular network topology . For example, molecular interaction
					networks have been found to cluster into regions that represent
					complexes and statistically over-represented motifs, such as
					feedback loops, have been discovered some of which have been
					thoroughly analyzed.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Network evolution.</b> Increasingly, interaction networks are
					being used to address questions of evolution, such as 'Which
					biological processes are conserved between species, and which are
					distinct?' A number of techniques have been developed that identify
					common network structures and organizational principles that are
					conserved across species. For example, our PathBLAST and
					NetworkBLAST tools align protein-protein interaction networks to
					identify conserved interaction paths and clusters, respectively.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Prediction of new interactions and functional associations.</b>
					Statistically significant domain-domain correlations in a protein
					interaction network suggest that certain domains (and domain pairs)
					mediate protein binding, allowing prediction of new via. Machine
					learning has also been applied to predict protein-protein or
					genetic interactions through integration of diverse types of
					evidence for interaction
				</p>

				<p>Beyond these established cases, Network Biology is playing an
					increasing role in the study of human disease, including:</p>
				<p>
					<b>Identification of disease subnetworks.</b> A recent and powerful
					trend is to identify neighborhoods of a biological network (i.e.,
					subnetworks) that are transcriptionally active in disease Such
					neighborhoods suggest key pathway components in disease progression
					and provide leads for further study and potential new therapeutic
					targets.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Subnetwork-based diagnosis.</b> It has become clear that
					subnetworks also provide a rich source of biomarkers for disease
					classification. Several groups have demonstrated that mRNA profiles
					can be integrated with protein networks to identify subnetwork
					biomarkers, i.e. subnetworks of interconnected genes whose
					aggregate expression levels are predictive of disease state.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Subnetwork-based gene association.</b> Despite the growing
					number of gene association studies based on Single Nucleotide
					Polymorphism (SNP) and Copy Number Variation (CNV) profiling, most
					human genetic variation remains uncharacterized, both in biological
					mechanism and in impact on disease pathology. We anticipate that
					molecular networks will provide a powerful framework for mapping
					the common pathway mechanisms impacted by a collection of
					genotypes, and several proofs-of-principle have recently been
					developed in this area.

			<div class="tab-pane" id="community-tab">
				<p>The Network Biology community has grown rapidly over the past
					few years. As an illustration of how pervasive networks have
					become, the U.S. National Institutes of Health currently funds 3076
					active research grants covering the topic "protein protein
					interactions" with 794 of these implementing the specific technique
					of "yeast two hybrid system". Network research is also actively
					supported by a variety of initiatives from other major national and
					supra-national funding agencies, such as the NSF, DOE, EU, and
					private foundations. As of 2009, approximately one-third of papers
					presented at the major Bioinformatics conferences (e.g., ISMB,
					RECOMB, ECCB, ICSB) focus on novel methodologies related to
					analysis or inference of biological networks- this number is up
					from less than one tenth at the beginning of the decade. Network
					Biology is also the focus of several major conferences per year,
					most recently including the CSHL / Welcome Trust Network Biology
					meeting (18 March 2009, Cold Spring Harbor) and Network Biology 2.0
					(20 May 2009, Broad Institute). This number is greater still if one
					expands to include conferences in the highly overlapping field of
					Systems Biology.</p>

					<a href="images/F2.png" target="_blank">Figure 1: Usage
						Statistics</a>
				</div>

				<p>Another metric of the growing community of network research
					is to track usage of software tools. For instance, use of Cytoscape
					has increased at a rate of ~50% per year since 2003, including
					nearly 30,000 downloads so far in 2009 and ~40,000 unique visits
					and ~50,000 page views per month currently (Figure 1).
					Cumulatively, the Cytoscape web page has been visited approximately
					one million times and the application has been downloaded ~90,000
					times. The original Cytoscape paper and the more recently released
					Cline, et al. paper have been cited over 1000 times and used
					uncited in many more (we are aware of many publications, including
					recent high-profile examples that use Cytoscape for visualization
					(i.e. generation of figures) and analysis but do not cite the
					Cytoscape publications). Figure 2 shows how a subset of these works
					has been supported by a collection of different NIH institutes as
					well as other funding agencies. These increases in software usage
					and development closely parallel the increases in availability of
					large-scale network information and its potential impacts in
					biomedicine.</p>

				<p>Thus, the importance of Network Biology is very much
					appreciated by basic scientists and clinicians, many of whom use
					interaction databases and network analysis tools in their
					day-to-day research. On the other hand, many other investigators
					(basic, clinical, and pharmaceutical) as of yet have little
					knowledge of recent developments in network biology and would
					benefit greatly from outreach and education centered on
					network-based technologies. With creation of a NRNB National
					Resource- focused on technology development supporting research,
					collaboration, education, and dissemination- the Network Biology
					community could potentially become a great deal larger.</p>
