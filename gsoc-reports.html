        <p>As the National Resource for Network Biology, we are used to working with scaling networks of complex interactions, 
        but there's nothing quite like the connections made through Google Summer of Code! This season we connected 26 of our 
        mentors with 14 students from 9 countries over 4 continents. But the interactions go deeper than that. This was our 
        7th year participating in GSoC and we had students returning from prior years for another round of the program along 
        with some past students who served as newly minted mentors themselves this year. And the output of these projects is 
        soon to be in the hands of thousands of researchers studying the role of network interactions in biology and medicine.</p>
        <p>We also experienced a tragic loss in our community this summer with the passing of Allan Kuchinsky, a champion of open 
        source, network biology and GSoC. In his honor, we put together the <a href="http://cytoscape.org/allanprize.html">
        Allan Kuchinsky Student Award</a> and presented it to 
        three of our GSoC students from this summer whose projects exemplified the principles of data visualization and good 
        user-centered design that Allan was so passionate about. Congratulations and thanks to these excellent students!</p> 
        <p>Finally, here are some great quotes from some of our GSoC students this year. If you're considering applying next 
        year -- the 10th year of GSoC! -- then these inspiring words should convince you.</p>
         <div class="row-fluid">
        <div class="span8 offset1">
        <p>"I've taken part in GSoC 4 times as a student working on network visualization techniques for 
        Cytoscape and Cytoscape.js. Over those occasions, I was lucky enough to work with great people from all over the 
        world (Hungary, USA, Canada, Turkey), and develop key abilities that will be really helpful in my professional future."
        - Gerardo Huck (Argentina) [<a href="https://github.com/gerardohuck">github</a>]</p>
        <p>"My project ended up with adding tests, squashing git commits and making a pull request into main 
        repository. Right after doing that I felt like I leveled up. The most important thing besides gathered experience is 
        the fact that I did something tangible and useful." - Truhin Alexandr (Republic of Moldova) 
        [<a href="https://github.com/bumbu">github</a>] [<a href="http://bumbu.me/blog/">blog</a>]</p>
        <p>"These unbelievable life changing four months came to an end on 27th Sept when I completed final 
        evaluations of GSoC. Things I learned as a part of GSoC: determination, collaboration with mentor and friends, and 
        patience to read articles and documentation. I obviously will contribute to Cytoscape in future. In short, thanks to 
        all the people involved in making GSoC 2013 a wonderful experience." - Shaik Faizaan (India) 
        [<a href="https://github.com/smd-faizan">github</a>]</p>
        <p>"This year's Google Summer of Code was quite an amazing and adventurous journey. It was very exciting 
        and was very challenging. ...I learned a lot during this brief term of GSOC. I was hit with several roadblocks during 
        the project but successfully solved them and made it to the end." - Sri Harsha P (India)

         <p>Thanks to all the NRNB mentors and students, to all the other mentoring organizations, and a big 
        thanks to the GSoC organizers. You have transformed how we work with students and new developers, and have catalyzed 
        a lot of great code. See you next year!</p>

        <p>The GenMAPP organization’s efforts focus on building software tools to analyze and visualize biological data. We 
        joined forces with Cytoscape, WikiPathways, PathVisio and Reactome for this year's Google Summer of Code to offer 
        students a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of biology and computing. This was our 4th year participating
        in the program and we reached some new milestones. We mentored 10 excellent students (more than any prior year) with a 
        100% success rate. We integrated and released more code from this summer’s harvest than in prior years. And most 
        importantly, we continued to expand our development community, as many of this year’s students are enthusiastic about 
        continuing to work with us beyond the summer. Our projects this year covered a broad range of topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alternative Splicing Analysis Plugin for Cytoscape, by Anurag Sharma</li>
            <li>CyAnnotator and CyAnimator Plugins, by Avinash Thummala</li>
            <li>User Interface Development in PathVisio, by Bing Liu</li>
            <li>Tools for Exploring Pathway Relations in WikiPathways, by Chetan Bansal</li>
            <li>Expression Data Reader plugin for Cytoscape, by Dazhi Jiao</li>
            <li>Improving Cytoscape’s Labels Experience, by Gerardo Huck</li>
            <li>KEGG Global Map Browser, by Kozo Nishida</li>
            <li>Semantic Network Summary for Cytoscape, by Layla Oesper</li>
            <li>Reactome-WikiPathways Converter, by Leontius Pradhana</li>
            <li>Edge-Weighted Layout for Cytoweb, by Tomithy Too</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As part of the open source experience, we invite our Google Summer of Code students to our annual Cytoscape 
        Retreat. This is a great way to engage students in both our development and user communities. One student pointed 
        out a truism that is rediscovered from time to time in our digital age, “face-to-face meetings turn out to be very 
        efficient.” Here are some other gems of reflection and advice from our students this year:</p>
        <div class="row-fluid">
        <div class="span8 offset1">
        <p> “The most rewarding part was when I was told that I should merge my changes back from my branch into 
        the trunk"</p>
        <p>“It has been the chance to meet and interact with wonderful people from various parts of the world, 
        be it virtual or physical. I had a chance to physically meet another graduate student from my university and a 
        professor from USA due to Google Summer of Code.”</p>
        <p>“They opened up my perspective about a lot of things — how the industry looks like, where people with 
        similar skill domain as me put themselves in the society, how important the projects I am involved in are, and other 
        subjects unimaginable if I were to not join Google Summer of Code.”</p>
        <p>“Got a taste of open-source development which is just amazing and I would like to keep attached with 
        this project even after this GSOC ends.”</p>
        <p>“This program is a great initiative, I loved the amount of exposure the participating students get 
        and it definitely is one of the most exciting summers someone can ever get.”</p>
        <p>“The most rewarding part is to be able to go to the cytoscape retreat. It is absolutely helpful to 
        the project, and helpful to get to know the mentors and others.”</p>
        <p>“Be the best user of the software. If you are the best user, you write and participate [in] the 
        software project spontaneously.”</p>
        <p>“At the beginning of the summer, I really had my doubts on whether or not I had gotten in too far 
        over my head. So I very much enjoy being able to look back at what I was able to accomplish and realize that I was 
        able to supersede my original expectations for myself.”</p>
        <p>“Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Your mentors are an amazing source of information, and they are 
        really interested in helping you in any way possible.”</p>
        <p>“Be cool.”</p>
