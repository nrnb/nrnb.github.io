            NRNB Academy offers you the opportunity to work with our open source
            development team on network biology related tools and resources. <b>This
            is a great introduction to our dev community and the workings of
            open source in general.</b> Browse the list of project ideas below or
            propose your own. Each project has one or more mentors available to
            guide your learning and production. The goals of the academy are to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Provide students with practical open source dev experience</li>
            <li>Provide hobbyists and professionals with introductory
                projects
            </li>
            <li>Promote development of scientific tools for network biology</li>

            <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>

            <p>
                If you are familiar with the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google
                Summer of Code program</a>, then you have the basic idea. The main
                difference is that this is a year-round program, accommodating
                students and non-students with flexible project dates ranging from 2
                to 12 months. Another difference is that it is a 100% unfunded,
                volunteer experience. But from <a
                    href="testimonials.html#student-tab">past testimonials</a>, you'll
                see that there are rewards greater than mere cash. Also browse the
                list of <a href="gsoc/alumni.html"> accepted NRNB Academy
                participants and their projects</a>. And you also get a certificate of completion!</p>

            <p>NRNB Academy organizes and matches projects and participants,
                providing structure, guidelines and outreach. The details and
                execution of each project is ultimately in the hands of you and your
                mentor. Most participants work remotely, staying in touch and
                coordinating with mentors and other project contributors via email,
                IRC, video chat, phone, etc. If you are near a mentor site or have
                an itch to travel, sometimes office space can be arranged.</p>

            <p>
                <b> Step 1: Determine if the program is right for you.</b> Carefully
                read through the program description and <a href="academy-faq.html">FAQ</a>.
                Contact <a href="mailto:khanspers@gladstone.ucsf.edu">the admin</a>
                with any questions not covered in these pages. <i>Note: asking
                questions answered in the FAQ may count against you!</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b> Step 2: Browse the current project ideas.</b> We maintain a
                running <a href="academy-ideas.html">list of potential project
                ideas</a>. Do a bit of background research on each idea that interests
                you. Or propose your own project idea related to NRNB tools and
                resources. Fill out the <a href="academy-admissions.html">Admissions
                Form</a> to start the ball rolling.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b> Step 3: Connect with your potential mentors.</b> After you've
                filled out the Admissions Form, the admin will follow up with you
                directly and put you in contact with your potential mentors. This
                begins the dialog about whether a given project is a good fit for
                you and the mentor.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b> Step 4: Submit your project proposal for approval.</b> NRNB
                Academy has a rolling enrollment, accepting members year-round. <b><i>Together</i></b>
                with your potential mentor, you will prepare and submit a detailed
                project proposal. Find a template application and instructions in
                the <a href="academy-faq.html">FAQ</a> <i>(which you should have
                already read in Step 1)</i>.
