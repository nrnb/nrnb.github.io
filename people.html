                <a href="http://chianti.ucsd.edu/idekerlab/" target="_blank"><b>Trey
                    Ideker, Ph.D.</b></a> is known for pioneering work in systems biology and a 
                track record of innovative and widely-used bioinformatic tools. Ideker received bachelor’s 
                and master’s degrees in computer science from MIT and a PhD in biomedical sciences working 
                with Dr. Lee Hood at the University of Washington. During graduate work, he developed a general 
                framework for how biological systems can be systematically perturbed and modeled which laid the 
                foundation for many systems biology studies. Using Cytoscape, he demonstrated that biological 
                networks could be integrated with gene expression to systematically map pathways and aligned, like 
                sequences, to reveal conserved and divergent functions. He showed that the best biomarkers of 
                disease may not be single proteins but aggregates of proteins in networks. Most recently, his group 
                demonstrated that protein networks contain deep hierarchical structure that recapitulates the majority 
                of cellular components in the Gene Ontology (data-driven ontologies) and provides a basis for deep 
                learning models of cell structure and function. Ideker was named a Top Innovator by Tech Review, is 
                recipient of the Overton Prize from the International Society for Computational Biology and is a fellow of 
                the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He serves on the Editorial Boards of Cell, Cell 
                Systems, Molecular Systems Biology, and PLoS Comp Bio. Directing NRNB builds on leadership positions such 
                as Director of the UCSD Bioinformatics Program and the San Diego Center for Systems Biology, and former 
                Chief of Genetics in the Department of Medicine.

                    Pico, Ph.D.</b></a> is the Associate Director of Bioinformatics at the Gladstone Institutes 
                on the UCSF Mission Bay Campus where he leads a systems biology technology development group. 
                After obtaining a PhD in 
                molecular neurobiology and biophysics from Rockefeller University in 2003, Dr. Pico joined 
                Gladstone as a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Bruce Conklin, where he lead 
                the development of GenMAPP and joined the Cytoscape development team. As a Senior 
                Staff Research Scientist, Dr. Pico develops software tools and resources that help analyze, 
                visualize and explore biomedical data in the context of biomolecular networks. He co-founded 
                WikiPathways in 2007 and has contributed to the development and leadership 
                of Cytoscape since 2006. Since 2007, he has organized the annual 
                Google Summer of Code program for Cytoscape and for NRNB starting in 2011. Dr. Pico received 
                the David Rockefeller Award in 2001, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Predoctoral Fellowship 
                from 1999-2003, the David and the Mary Phillips Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellowship for 2005-2006.
                He was recognized by Web of Science and Clarivate as a researcher "with substantial influence across 
                several fields" as part of Highly Cited Researchers 2018 (www.highlycited.com).

                analysis and pathway information resources as a Professor at The Donnelly Centre at the University of 
                Toronto. He helped found the field of network biology with early contributions to network visualization 
                and modeling, database resources and analysis. He was included twice (for Biology/Biochemistry 
                and Computer Science) on the Thomson Reuters list of most influential scientists worldwide in 2014 and 
                once again in 2018 (www.highlycited.com). His research focuses on identifying causal pathways in disease 
                and in precision medicine (predicting patient outcome based on genetic, molecular, pathway and clinical 
                data). For example, using his methods, his team identified novel pathways involved in autism spectrum 
                disorder and the first potential therapy for a devastating pediatric brain cancer. He completed 
                post-doctoral work in Chris Sander’s group in the Computational Biology Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering 
                Cancer Center in New York. Gary developed the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND) during his 
                Ph.D.
